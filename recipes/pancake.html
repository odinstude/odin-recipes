    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients needed for making pancakes: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, milk, eggs, and butter.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add milk and melted butter, stirring until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Preheat a non-stick griddle or skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour the pancake batter onto the hot griddle to form pancakes of desired size.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes and the edges look set, then flip with a spatula and cook until golden brown on the other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and keep warm while you cook the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes hot with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade pancakes for breakfast or any time of the day!</li>
